Calling all software developers, web designers, consultants and IT-business owners in and around the Helderberg area. Are you tired of having to drive to Cape Town to meet other software enthusiasts? Well then, lets meet up under our own mountain! Anyone interested in software development, architecture, design or building a business with or around software, please join us.

Meetups are *usually* held on the first Tuesday of each month, but check our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/helderberg.swdev.entrep.meetups) for scheduled meetups.

Feel free to join our discussion channel, `#helderberg-devs` on [ZATech Slack](https://zatech.co.za/).

Contact us through either the Facebook page or Slack channel.
