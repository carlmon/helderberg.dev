Calling all software developers, web designers, consultants and IT-business owners in and around the Helderberg area. Are you tired of having to drive to Cape Town to meet other software enthusiasts? Well then, lets meet up under our own mountain! Anyone interested in software development, architecture, design or building a business with or around software, please join us.

Meetups are *usually* held on the first Tuesday of each month, but check our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/helderberg.swdev.entrep.meetups/events) for scheduled meetups.

Even if you're not yet planning to attend an event, feel free to join the [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/helderberg.swdev.entrep.meetups) so that you can stay up to date. If you *are* planning to come to an event, we would appreciate it if you could indicate attendance by clicking on the "going" button of that event, so that we can better estimate the required catering.

Feel free to join our discussion channel, [`#helderberg-devs` on ZATech Slack](https://zatech.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=helderberg-devs).

Contact us through either the Facebook page or Slack channel.
